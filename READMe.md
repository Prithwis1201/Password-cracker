# Password-cracker
This is a python based simple password cracker, you can integrate this in your vulnerablity code, It could be a part of that project. I made this so that you can just come up here to github and get the stuff you need and piece it all together.

Just open VS code and paste the python code given.
If you want to integrate it into exploiting tools you will have to write a code with binding handshakes to procure the pass. letter by letter, It will crack it but it will take time.
So be patient and trust it.
Works best on shorter and alphanumerical passwords you can adjust its character data deposit by modifying the data reserve in the code (Line 8).
